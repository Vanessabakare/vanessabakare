# 👋 Hi, I’m Vanessa!

## What I Bring to the Table
Before cloud engineering, I trained in English and project management—skills that sharpen clear communication, structured thinking, and stakeholder empathy. I’m **currently undertaking an MSc in Computer Science**, strengthening my grounding in software engineering and systems design.

I bring those principles into DevOps/Cloud:

- **Communication →** crisp docs and knowledge-sharing that help teams move faster together
- **Systems thinking →** Infrastructure as Code for repeatable, auditable environments
- **Cost awareness →** practical optimisation that reduces spend without hurting performance
- **Security mindset →** least-privilege access and secure-by-default workflows
- **Reliability →** resilient **Kubernetes** platforms with safe rollouts and quick recovery

## Core Expertise

### Kubernetes & Containers
- Deploying, scaling, and troubleshooting containerised workloads (**EKS**, **minikube**, **kind**)
- Workloads, Services/Ingress, HPA, ConfigMaps/Secrets; rollout strategies (blue/green, canary)
- Helm charts for repeatable packaging and environment parity
- Container security (image scanning, least-privilege, secrets management)

### AWS Platform
EC2 • S3 • Lambda • DynamoDB • API Gateway • IAM • CloudWatch • CloudFormation

### Infrastructure as Code
Terraform & CloudFormation for consistent, version-controlled environments

### CI/CD
GitHub Actions pipelines, automated tests, deploys to EKS/Lambda with rollbacks

### Serverless
Event-driven services with AWS Lambda + API Gateway

### Tooling
Docker • AWS CLI • Git/GitHub • Linux/Ubuntu • Bash scripting • Python

### Documentation & Collaboration
Runbooks, onboarding guides, process write-ups

## Recent Achievements
- Reduced manual provisioning time by **40%** through IaC and pipeline automation
- Cut non-prod cloud spend by **~25%** via rightsizing and scheduling
- Containerised services and standardised deploys with Helm, enabling safer **EKS** rollouts
- Partnered with security to enforce least-privilege IAM and add image-scanning in CI
- Authored deployment/runbook documentation to speed onboarding and incident response

---

## Education & Credentials
- **MSc Computer Science — in progress**
- **Diploma in Cloud Engineering — AltSchool Africa**
- **BA English & Literary Studies — University of Ibadan**
- **Certifications:** AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner; GitHub Foundations; UCI Project Management Principles & Practices

## What Excites Me
Teams that value technical excellence **and** clear communication. I love designing pragmatic cloud/**Kubernetes** architectures, baking in security and cost-efficiency, and explaining the “why” so everyone can operate with confidence.

## Currently Seeking
Remote/hybrid **Junior–Mid Cloud/DevOps** roles—especially in SaaS, healthtech, and fintech—where I can own infrastructure, improve pipelines, and uplift team practices.

**Roles of interest:** Cloud/DevOps Engineer • Platform Engineer • SRE
